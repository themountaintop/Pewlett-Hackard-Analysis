# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to determine how many employees are getting ready to retire, which positions they hold, and to identify those who are eligible for the mentorship program. This would allow the company to plan ahead in terms of replacing those postions with new hires and to hopefully promote current employees via the mentorship program.

## Results

* There are a total of 300,024 employees, with 72,458 (24.15%) of those employees being eligible for retirement.
* The two largest groups with retirement-eligible employees are Senior Engineer (25,916) and Senior Staff (24,926):

* It appears that the majority of eligible retirees are from Development and Production.

## Summary

* There are 72,458 total roles that will need to be filled once the "silver tsunami" takes place. Snapshot from the query is shown below. It shows which department and which position will need to be filled once the retirements start taking place:

* There are enough retirement-eligible employees to mentor and train the next generation of employees but there are only 1,549 current employees who are eligble for the mentorship program. Either the standards for the program needs to be changed/relaxed or the company needs to look at hiring candidates who are already qualified and ready to take on the higher-level role from day one. Also to note: not all of the Senior-level employees may be qualified or willing to take on the mentorship of another employee. Whether they are qualified or not is not something we can measure within this specific dataset.
* To check the amount of staff we have that _may_ be qualified, I ran a query to see how many high-level staff we had that were leaving that could be possible mentors:

There are more than a few retirements that are coming for Pewlett-Hackard and it is advised that the HR departments start looking into getting current people trained for promotion and at hiring staff that are already at a level needed to fill many of the senior level positions.
